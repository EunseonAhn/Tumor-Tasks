# PsychoPy AVSpeech Task
A. Roelofs, May 2020

## Basics
This is for David Brang in Psychology. It's a conversion of a MATLAB task that had been created
in Psychtoolbox. This is intended to be used online via Pavlovia.org.

It was developed in PsychoPy3 desktop version 2020.1.1 on a MacBook Pro.

## Notes
Based on email with David Brang, only code the 'SF' option for now. This sets:
* 1 block
* 12 conditions
* 10 trails per condition
Omit visual-only trials; all trials will have sound. Counterbalancing for which stimuli are given
which conditions is random across subjects.
